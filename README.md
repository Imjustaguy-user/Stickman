So this is gonna be my first actual platformer on Game Maker. I do have another project like that, but it was only for me following a tutorial.

Stickman is a cool game that is on develompt, but soon, it will be finished. Here are some ideas that I would like to add:
1. A settings button at the title screen.
2. A sword
3. Blocks used as sheilds.
4. A pencil used as a power-up.
5. Enemies separted to differet enviortments.

Sorry if some words have been misspelled, that's because I'm using my memory. Anyways more ideas coming soon!

To build the source, you need:
1. Game Maker
2. GML Code
